## Usage

1. Install ```Tampermonkey``` browser extension from [Tampermonkey website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Install ```KeepChatGPT```, you can select a repository from ```Installation repositories```.
3. Open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and enjoy the smooth experience.
4. Additionally, there is a more clever way, which is to ask ChatGPT: "How to install the Tampermonkey extension? How to install the userscript from Greasy Fork?"
